Three observable trends from the plots of data in Part 1:

1. Temperature is generally higher as a cities latitude is lower, or more towards the equator.

2. Humidity is generally higher as a cities latitude is lower, or more towards the equator.

3. Cloudiness is all over the place, with no real correlation to a cities location, however, cities appear to generally be very cloudy or not cloudy at all.
